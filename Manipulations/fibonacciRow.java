/*Alicia has arranged some numbers beginning from 0 in a particular sequence. The arrangement contains some rows and some columns. The number of elements in a row ’n’ is equal to the nth Fibonacci number. Here is a glimpse of the arrangement:
0
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11
12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
…

She is interested in knowing the median of any given row ’n’. The median is equal to the (q/2)th number if the number of elements in the row is q, and q is even. If q is odd, the median is (q+1)/2)th number*/
